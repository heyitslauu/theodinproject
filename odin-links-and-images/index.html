    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>This is now an example for Links and Images</p>
    <p>Anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <b>&lt;a&gt</b> tag. </p>
    <hr>
    <a>Click Me</a> 
    <p>The 'click me' above will not work since there is no href to point to.</p>
    <a href="https://wwww.google.com">Go to Google</a> <span><b>If you click the link, you will be redirected to Google</b></span>
    <p>By default, there is a text decoration for anchor elements. This is a way to easily check if something is a link. We can just style it later on with CSS.</p> 
    <hr>
    <p>We can also create links that will open with NEW TAB when the link is clicked</p>
    <p>We use the <code>target="_blank"'</code> to allow the link to open in a new tab instead of self. By default, if target attribute is not set, the behavior of anchor tags are <code>target="_self"'</code></p>

    <h1>There are also 2 types of links</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Relative Links</li>
        <li>Absolute Links</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Relative Links</b> are links to other pages within our own website. For example, if we have another page called 'about', we can use relative link to go to that page instead.</p>
    <p>Here is an example. Click <a href="./pages/about.html">here</a> to go to the About Page of this Website</p>
    <hr>
    <section>
        <h1>This is the section for Images</h1>
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="an image of a dog">
        <p>The <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag is a self-closing tag, which means it does not need a closing pair</p>
        <p>We can also add an 'alt' attribute to our img tag to provide an alternative text.</p>
        <p>'alt' attribute is used by the screen readers to describe an image</p>
